DEFINITIONS:
	Key Results are sharp criteria that represent how far the goal has been achieved and enrich it by revealing different aspects of the goal.
	Each key result text must contain three dimensions: time dimension, measurability dimension and impact area dimension.
	There must be expressions specifically and explicitly written for each of the 3 dimensions.
	The measurability dimension sets the numeric standards for the action, such as "X number of products," "Y amount of revenue," "Z number of customers," "%100'ünün tamamlanması", "3 adet proje", "%50 katılım" etc.
	The time dimension means when key result must be finished.
	You must provide variety by using different time dimensions in each KR such as "Üçüncü çeyrek sonuna kadar", "İlk çeyrek sonuna kadar" etc.
	The time dimension you write for the KRs must be within the year 2024.
	The impact area identifies the working sphere and/or group of people and/or location affected by the action, such as "company-wide," "within the community," "external customers," “projects,” “platforms,” “local/global markets,” “European market,” etc.
	Key results should be framed as a single complete sentence.
